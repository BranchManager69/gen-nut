*MNT bio:*

**Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)** in the outpatient setting refers to evidence-based, individualized nutrition care provided by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) to manage and treat medical conditions. MNT involves a comprehensive nutrition assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation. It is often prescribed for conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and obesity but this list is not limited when using Generational Nutrition’s services. The goal is to support clinical outcomes by improving or maintaining a patient’s nutritional status and managing disease symptoms through dietary and lifestyle modifications.

At **Generational Nutrition**, we believe lasting health starts with sustainable habits. That’s why we offer **Lifestyle Intervention Therapy Counseling**—a personalized approach that works hand-in-hand with **Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)** to support long-term wellness.

Our counseling goes beyond just food. We take a whole-person approach, talking about things like movement, stress, sleep, and other lifestyle factors that impact your health. Together, we focus on realistic goal-setting, problem-solving, and learning strategies that fit your everyday life. Using proven methods like motivational interviewing and tailored education, we help guide you toward meaningful, lasting change.

At Generational Nutrition, we take the time to understand your unique needs, your current routine, and your vision for change. From there, we help you build achievable goals that align with your life—not just today, but for the long run. This is where the creation of better habits begin—and where wellness truly becomes life long and even further, *generational.*

*Approach* bio:

My Approach to Care

As a Registered Dietitian, my approach to care is rooted in **compassion, collaboration, and personalization**. I take a patient-centered and individualized approach, meaning your unique lifestyle, preferences, medical history, and personal goals guide every part of our work together. I begin with a **comprehensive assessment** to understand where you're starting from—physically, emotionally, and practically—so we can build a plan that truly fits your life.

Rather than focusing on quick fixes or one-size-fits-all advice, I provide **ongoing education, support, and accountability** to help you make lasting, meaningful changes. Whether you're managing a health condition, navigating a new diagnosis, or simply wanting to improve your relationship with food and your body, I’m here to walk beside you with evidence-based strategies and real-life tools.

What to Expect in Your First Session

During our first session, my goal is to get to know **you—not just your health history,** but your life as a **whole**. I’ll introduce myself, explain how our sessions work, and ask questions that help me understand your lifestyle, routines, challenges, and what you're hoping to achieve through nutrition counseling.

This conversation allows me to design a **personalized care plan** tailored to your needs and preferences—one that feels both realistic and empowering. Together, we’ll begin mapping out a path that makes your health goals not only feasible, but truly attainable and sustainable for the long term. Every step we take will be collaborative, with room for adjustments as your life and needs evolve.

*About me* bio:

About Me

Hi, I’m **Renee Hertenberger**, a Registered Dietitian with a passion for integrative medicine and the powerful role food plays in our overall health and well-being. I believe nutrition is more than just what we eat—it’s deeply connected to our **social lives, emotions, behaviors, and identity**. Food is a bridge between the physical and emotional aspects of life, and I strive to help people rebuild that connection in a healthy, sustainable way.

In my practice, I create a safe, supportive space for open conversations about food, health, and the body. I understand that everyone’s journey is unique, and I approach care with **compassion, curiosity, and respect**. My goal is to meet you where you are, listen to your story, and work with you to create a plan that aligns with your values, lifestyle, and long-term goals.

Using an **evidence-based approach**, I help individuals navigate chronic conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal disorders through personalized lifestyle changes that feel realistic and empowering. I also focus on helping clients develop a healthier relationship with food, their bodies, and the conditions being faced, breaking down barriers like guilt, confusion, or fear around eating.

Whether you're newly diagnosed, seeking preventative care, or simply wanting to feel more in control of your health, I’m here to guide and support you. Together, we’ll create a path that supports not only your physical health but also your emotional and mental well-being—because true wellness is about more than just numbers or meal plans; it’s about living a life filled with the energy, confidence, and freedom to pursue what matters most to you.
